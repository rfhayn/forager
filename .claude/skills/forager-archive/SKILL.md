# Archive & Distribute to TestFlight

Full pipeline: version bump → archive → upload → distribute via script.

**CRITICAL: Permission-safe execution.** Run each operation as a SEPARATE Bash tool call. Never chain commands with `&&`, `||`, or pipes. Never combine multiple operations in one Bash call. One command per call. This ensures all commands match pre-approved permission patterns.

## Current State

- Marketing version: !`grep -m1 'MARKETING_VERSION' forager.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
- Build number: !`grep -m1 'CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION' forager.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
- Branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Uncommitted changes: !`git status --short`

**API key check** — Run this as your first step (do NOT use `!` backtick for this since it's outside the project dir):
```bash
test -f ~/.appstoreconnect/config && echo "API KEY CONFIGURED" || echo "NOT CONFIGURED"
```

## Prerequisites: App Store Connect API Key

The TestFlight automation requires an App Store Connect API key. Check if configured (run as a Bash call):

```bash
test -f ~/.appstoreconnect/config && cat ~/.appstoreconnect/config || echo "NOT CONFIGURED"
```

**If not configured**, guide the user through setup:

1. Go to **App Store Connect → Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API**
2. Click **Generate API Key** (or use existing)
3. Role: **Developer** (minimum for TestFlight management)
4. Download the `.p8` file (can only download ONCE)
5. Note the **Key ID** and **Issuer ID** shown on the page

Then create the config:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys

# User provides these values:
cat > ~/.appstoreconnect/config << 'EOF'
KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
ISSUER_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
EOF

# User places their .p8 file:
# cp ~/Downloads/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8 ~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/
```

**If API key is not set up and user wants to skip TestFlight automation**, run steps 1-6 only and report that TestFlight distribution was skipped.

## Step 1: Pre-Flight Checks

Verify before archiving:
- [ ] On `main` branch (archives should be from main after PR merge)
- [ ] Working tree is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] Build succeeds in Release configuration

If not on main or there are uncommitted changes, warn the user and ask whether to proceed.

## Step 2: Auto-Increment Build Number

The build number (`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`) auto-increments on every archive.

**Read current value** — run as separate calls:
```bash
grep -m1 'CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = ' forager.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
```
Parse the number from output. Compute NEW_BUILD = CURRENT_BUILD + 1.

**Update both Debug and Release** — single script call:
```bash
Tools/bump-build.sh CURRENT_BUILD NEW_BUILD
```

**Show result** and confirm with user:
```
Version: 1.2 (build 24)
```

## Step 3: Optional — Bump Marketing Version

Only if the user explicitly requests a version bump (e.g., `/archive --version 1.3`):

```bash
# $ARGUMENTS may contain: --version X.Y
# If present, update MARKETING_VERSION in the first two occurrences (app target only)
```

Marketing version format: `MAJOR.MINOR` (e.g., 1.2, 1.3, 2.0). Validate format before applying.

## Step 4: Commit Version Bump

Use the current milestone from `docs/current-story.md` for the commit prefix. If no active milestone, use a generic prefix.

Run as three separate calls:
```bash
git add forager.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
```
```bash
git commit -m "Bump build number to $NEW_BUILD for TestFlight"
```
```bash
git push
```

## Step 5: Archive

```bash
xcodebuild archive \
  -project forager.xcodeproj \
  -scheme forager \
  -archivePath ~/Desktop/forager-$MARKETING_VERSION-$NEW_BUILD.xcarchive \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  2>&1 | tail -5
```

This uses Release configuration by default (CloudKit enabled).

On success, report:
- Archive path
- Version and build number
- Archive size

On failure:
- Show full error output
- Check signing issues first (most common)

## Step 6: Export & Upload to App Store Connect

Use the Write tool to create `/tmp/ForagerExportOptions.plist` with this content:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>method</key>
    <string>app-store-connect</string>
    <key>teamID</key>
    <string>93FT2PT9NM</string>
    <key>destination</key>
    <string>upload</string>
    <key>signingStyle</key>
    <string>automatic</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Then run export as a separate call:
```bash
xcodebuild -exportArchive -archivePath ~/Desktop/forager-$MARKETING_VERSION-$NEW_BUILD.xcarchive -exportOptionsPlist /tmp/ForagerExportOptions.plist -exportPath ~/Desktop/forager-export -allowProvisioningUpdates
```

The `destination: upload` auto-uploads to App Store Connect. If upload fails, fall back to:
```bash
xcrun notarytool submit ... # or Transporter.app / Xcode Organizer
```

## Step 7: TestFlight Distribution (Automated Script)

After upload succeeds, run the distribution script. This single command handles:
- JWT generation
- Build processing poll (up to 20 minutes)
- Export compliance verification
- "What to Test" notes (from latest commit or custom text)
- Beta review submission + approval wait
- Adding build to Public Beta Testers group

```bash
Tools/appstore-connect/testflight-distribute.sh $NEW_BUILD
```

Or with custom "What to Test" notes:
```bash
Tools/appstore-connect/testflight-distribute.sh $NEW_BUILD "Custom release notes here"
```

The script outputs progress and a final report. If it fails at any step, it exits with a non-zero code and an error message.

**If the script fails**, check:
- JWT issues → verify `~/.appstoreconnect/config` and `.p8` file
- Build not found → upload may still be propagating, wait 2 min and re-run
- Review stuck → check App Store Connect web UI

## Step 8: Final Report

After the script completes, report:

```
✅ Archive & TestFlight Distribution Complete

Version:       $MARKETING_VERSION (build $NEW_BUILD)
Archive:       ~/Desktop/forager-$MARKETING_VERSION-$NEW_BUILD.xcarchive
Status:        Available to testers (see script output for details)
```

## Arguments

- No arguments: full pipeline (archive → upload → distribute to **Public Beta Testers**)
- `--version X.Y`: also bump marketing version (e.g., `/archive --version 1.3`)
- `--no-upload`: archive and export only, skip TestFlight upload and distribution
- `--no-wait`: upload only, skip distribution script
- `--dry-run`: show what would happen without making changes
- `--testflight-only`: skip archive/upload, run only the distribution script (for builds already uploaded)

## Configuration

- **Team ID**: 93FT2PT9NM
- **Bundle ID**: com.richhayn.forager
- **Signing**: Automatic (Apple Development → Distribution managed by Xcode)
- **CloudKit**: Enabled in Release, disabled in Debug
- **API Key Config**: `~/.appstoreconnect/config` (KEY_ID, ISSUER_ID)
- **API Key File**: `~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/AuthKey_{KEY_ID}.p8`
- **JWT Generator**: `Tools/appstore-connect/generate-jwt.swift`
- **Distribution Script**: `Tools/appstore-connect/testflight-distribute.sh`

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `No signing certificate` | Open Xcode → Signing & Capabilities → resolve. Or: `security find-identity -v -p codesigning` |
| `Provisioning profile` | Xcode auto-manages. Try: Xcode → Preferences → Accounts → Download Manual Profiles |
| `Export failed` | Try `xcodebuild -exportArchive` with `-allowProvisioningUpdates` flag |
| `Upload rejected` | Check build number isn't reused. App Store Connect rejects duplicate build numbers per version |
| `JWT generation failed` | Verify .p8 file path and format. Run: `swift Tools/appstore-connect/generate-jwt.swift <path> <key-id> <issuer-id>` manually |
| `API returns 401` | JWT may be expired (20 min). Script auto-refreshes after 15 poll cycles |
| `API returns 403` | API key role too restrictive. Needs at least "Developer" role |
| `Build not found after upload` | Wait 2-5 minutes for propagation, then re-run the distribution script |
| `Build stuck in PROCESSING` | Normal for up to 15 min. If >30 min, check App Store Connect web UI |
| `Export compliance already set` | Info.plist has `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption`. Script handles this automatically |
