# Session Startup Checklist

Run this checklist at the start of every session. No exceptions.

## Step 1: Check Setup

Read `CLAUDE.md` and check if the Setup Checklist has uncompleted items. If so, remind the user.

## Step 2: Load Context Documents

Read these files in order:
1. `docs/openspec-workflow-reference.md` — canonical naming + workflow reference (if present; graceful skip with "workflow ref: not found" notice if missing)
2. `docs/project-brief.md` — living summary: capability map, service registry, skill inventory, ADR index, active work pointer, known debt (if present; graceful skip with "project-brief: not found" notice if missing)
3. `docs/session-startup-checklist.md`
4. `docs/project-naming-standards.md`
5. `docs/current-story.md`
6. `docs/next-prompt.md` (the hub/index)

Then check for branch-specific next-prompt files:
- Get current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Detect identifier format via shared utility: `bash .claude/skills/_shared/milestone-format.sh "<id-from-branch>"` outputs `format=M|kebab` and normalizes the id
  - Branch `feature/M1.2.3-description` → identifier `M1.2.3`, format `M`
  - Branch `feature/architecture-compliance-sweep` → identifier `architecture-compliance-sweep`, format `kebab`
- If `docs/next-prompt-[identifier].md` exists, read it too
- If on `main`, check `docs/next-prompt.md` for active milestone pointers and read the relevant files

## Step 3: Check Git State

Current branch and status:
- Branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Status: !`git status --short`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5`

## Step 4: Set Status Line

Write the active identifier and step to a **branch-keyed** status file so the status line displays it for the entire session. This prevents multiple sessions from overwriting each other.

Parse the active identifier and current step from `current-story.md`. Determine the branch slug by replacing `/` with `-` in the branch name. Detect format via `.claude/skills/_shared/milestone-format.sh`.

Format by identifier type:
- **Legacy M-format**: `[M#.#] feature-name .# step-name`
  - `[M16.9] ml-model-retraining .3 full-retrain`
  - `[M7.7] app-store-submission`
- **OpenSpec change-id format**: `[<change-id>] <optional-phase>`
  - `[architecture-compliance-sweep] phase 1`
  - `[expand-claude-context-infrastructure]`

Use a single line. The step/phase is optional — include it when a sub-milestone or phase is active.

```bash
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
SLUG=$(echo "$BRANCH" | tr '/' '-')
# Identifier detected from branch via milestone-format.sh (e.g., M7.7 or architecture-compliance-sweep)
echo "[<identifier>] <phase-or-feature-name>" > ~/.claude/forager-status-${SLUG}.txt
```

## Step 5: Check Active OpenSpec Changes

Check if there are any active (non-archived) changes:
```bash
ls openspec/changes/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v archive
```

If active changes exist, read their `tasks.md` to understand what's in progress.

## Step 6: Report

After reading all documents, provide a concise status report:

1. **Current milestone**: What M#.#.# is active, what status
2. **Branch check**: Are we on the correct feature branch? Flag if on `main`
3. **Uncommitted work**: Any staged/unstaged changes?
4. **Setup status**: Any unconfigured items in CLAUDE.md Setup Checklist?
5. **Next action**: What should we work on based on current-story.md and the branch-specific next-prompt

## Step 7: Red Flag Check

Verify:
- [ ] Not on `main` (should be on feature branch for any code work)
- [ ] Branch identifier matches a valid format (M#.#.# legacy OR kebab change-id) — `bash .claude/skills/_shared/milestone-format.sh` exits non-zero on malformed names
- [ ] Current work is documented in current-story.md
- [ ] OpenSpec change exists for active work (or next-prompt file as legacy fallback)
- [ ] No duplicate services being created

If any red flags are found, report them before proceeding.
