# Core Data Impact Analysis

**Entity**: $ARGUMENTS

Required by ADR 007 (`docs/architecture/007-core-data-change-process.md`) before ANY schema changes.

## Step 1: Read ADR 007

Read `docs/architecture/007-core-data-change-process.md` for the required process.

## Step 2: Entity Audit

For the target entity, find and document:

### Properties & Types
Search `Models/<EntityName>+CoreDataProperties.swift` for:
- All property names and their types
- Optional vs required
- Default values

### Relationships
- All relationships and their inverses
- Cascade delete rules
- Nullify rules

### Codegen Setting
- **Class Definition** (auto-generated) or **Manual/None** (custom extensions)?
- If Manual: what custom logic exists in extensions?

### Fetch Indexes
- What fields are indexed?
- What predicates are commonly used?

## Step 3: Usage Search

Search the entire codebase for references to this entity:

### Services
Search `Services/` for all methods that read or write this entity.

### Views
Search `forager/Views/` for `@FetchRequest` and other references.

### Repositories
Search `forager/Repositories/` for query methods.

### Tests
Search `foragerTests/` for test coverage.

## Step 4: Impact Report

Produce a structured report:

```markdown
## Core Data Impact Analysis: [EntityName]

### Current Schema
- Properties: [list with types]
- Relationships: [list with inverses]
- Codegen: [Class Definition / Manual]
- Indexes: [list]

### Files Affected by Change
- Services: [list]
- Views: [list]
- Repositories: [list]
- Tests: [list]

### Migration Impact
- Current model version: v6
- New version needed: v7
- Migration type: lightweight / manual
- CloudKit impact: [append-only constraint check]

### Risk Assessment
- [Identified risks]
- [Mitigation strategy]
```

## Step 5: Scope-Aware Fetch Audit (ADR 013)

If the entity has a `householdKey` property, verify:

### Fetch Scope Compliance
- [ ] Every `fetchRequest()` in services includes a `householdKey` predicate
- [ ] No unscoped fetches return user-facing data (ghost object risk)
- [ ] `householdKey` is passed as a parameter, not assumed from global state

### Zone Safety
- [ ] Any overwrite/replace operation validates the target object is in an accessible store
- [ ] Pre-mutation cleanup runs before `container.share()` operations
- [ ] Orphaned objects (stale `householdKey`, parentless Ingredients) are handled

### Entities requiring scope audit
Recipe, WeeklyList, MealPlan, PlannedMeal, Category, IngredientTemplate

See `docs/architecture/013-scope-aware-fetch-pattern.md` for the full pattern.

## Step 6: Factory Compliance Check (ADR 014)

If the entity conforms to `HouseholdScoped`, verify:

- [ ] All creation sites use `ManagedObjectFactory.make()` (not direct `Entity(context:)`)
- [ ] Services that create this entity have `var factory: ManagedObjectFactory?` property
- [ ] Factory is injected via `foragerApp.init()` or `performScopedWrite`
- [ ] Exempt sites documented: tests, previews, seeders, HouseholdService migration

Run `/forager-architecture-audit` to verify compliance.

HouseholdScoped entities: `WeeklyList`, `Recipe`, `PlannedMeal`, `MealPlan`, `Category`, `IngredientTemplate`

## Critical Reminders

- CloudKit Production schema is **append-only** — no destructive changes
- New model version requires incrementing from v8 (current) — update as needed
- Test with sample data before migrating production
- Follow M3 Phase 3 pattern for migrations (successful isStaple migration)
- **ADR 013**: All service fetches on household-scoped entities MUST include `householdKey` predicate
