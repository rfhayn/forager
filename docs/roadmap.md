## 🔍 **RISK MANAGEMENT**

_[Existing risks remain, adding new ones]_

### **M7.5: Parsing Resilience**
- **Risk**: Time overrun beyond 4 hours
- **Mitigation**: Simple UI, pre-built telemetry patterns
- **Risk**: Users ignore "Review" indicators
- **Mitigation**: Non-blocking design, telemetry shows usage

### **M8.0: Parsing Improvements**
- **Risk**: Apple NLP not accurate enough for complex patterns
- **Mitigation**: Pattern-specific handlers as fallback
- **Risk**: Performance degradation from NLP
- **Mitigation**: Fast path (regex) for 80% of inputs unchanged
- **Risk**: Insufficient telemetry data from M7
- **Mitigation**: Requires 2+ weeks of M7 external beta data before starting

### **M9.5: ML-Powered Parsing (Optional)**
- **Risk**: Insufficient training data (<100 corrections)
- **Mitigation**: Don't pursue until data threshold met
