## ✅ **M7.2.2: LEAVE HOUSEHOLD - COMPLETE**

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Sessions**: January 18 - February 2, 2026
**Key Achievement**: Full member leave flow with data migration, CKShare cleanup, owner notification, rejoin support, and code cleanup

### **What Was Implemented** ✅

**1. Member Leave Flow (HouseholdService.swift)**
- `leaveHousehold()` - Complete leave sequence with data migration option
- `migrateHouseholdDataToPersonal()` - Full data migration (recipes, categories, ingredient templates, lists)
- `deleteCKShareFromSharedDatabase()` - Member self-removal from CKShare (workaround for CloudKit limitation)
- `purgeAllSharedStoreObjects(from:)` - Extracted shared-store purge helper on PersistenceController
- `destroyAndRecreateSharedStore()` - Nuclear cleanup of shared store

**2. Owner-Controlled Member Removal**
- Owner can remove members from household via CKShare participant management
- Real-time leave request detection via Combine sync observer
- Local notification to owner when member leaves

**3. Rejoin Fix & Keychain Tracking**
- `KeychainHelper` - Persistent tracking of left households (survives app reinstall)
- Fixed re-joining blocked by stale left-household flag
- Proper cleanup on successful rejoin

**4. PasteInvitationSheet API Fix**
- Changed from `CKContainer.accept(metadata)` to `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer.acceptShareInvitations(from:into:)`
- Matches SceneDelegate pattern for consistent sync behavior

**5. Dead Code Removal & Optimization (~450 lines removed)**
- Removed 9 dead functions: `stopParticipatingInShare`, `fetchShare`, `createHousehold(name:ownerName:)`, `createCloudKitShare`, `getCurrentUserDisplayName`, `getDisplayNameFromShare`, `waitForCloudKitExport`, `waitForMemberDeletionSync`, `removeParticipantFromShare`, `syncParticipantsFromShare`
- Extracted `purgeAllSharedStoreObjects(from:)` to PersistenceController
- CKShare caching opportunity identified for future optimization

**6. Invitation Message Enhancement**
- Outgoing text message includes friendly description above iCloud link
- CKShare title set to "Join [Household Name] on forager"

### **Commits on Branch**
1. `73a1909` - M7.2.2: Add real-time leave request detection via Combine sync observer
2. `463ab89` - M7.2.2: Fix re-joining household blocked by stale left-household flag
3. `a5dd9a6` - M7.2.2: Switch to owner-controlled member removal, fix recipe picker duplication
4. `9f47102` - M7.2.2: Harden leave flow — CKShare deletion, shared store nuke, rejoin fix
5. `c84cb20` - M7.2.2: Remove dead code, extract purge helper, fix PasteInvitationSheet API

### **Files Modified/Created**
- `Services/HouseholdService.swift` - Major refactor (~450 lines removed, leave flow hardened)
- `Services/Persistence/PersistenceController.swift` - Added `purgeAllSharedStoreObjects(from:)` helper
- `Services/KeychainHelper.swift` - NEW: Persistent left-household tracking
- `forager/PasteInvitationSheet.swift` - Fixed acceptance API
- `forager/ShareSheet.swift` - Invitation message enhancement

## **Previous Session Progress**

### **M7.3.1: Rename Household** ✅ COMPLETE (Jan 13, 2026)
- Owner-only household renaming functionality
- Inline text field edit UI in Settings

### **M7.2.3: CloudKit Hardening** ✅ COMPLETE (Jan 4, 2026)
- Dual-store architecture (private + shared)
- Scope-based store assignment
- CategoryDeduplicator for multi-device sync
- Attach-then-share migration

### **M7.2.2: Member Invitation** ✅ COMPLETE (Jan 12, 2026)
- Public link sharing (bypassed UICloudSharingController bugs)
- CKShare.participants as source of truth

---

## **Known Issues & Limitations**

1. **CloudKit Limitation**: Members cannot remove themselves from CKShare.participants
   - Workaround: `deleteCKShareFromSharedDatabase()` deletes CKShare from shared database
2. **Migration**: PlannedMeals not migrated (require recipe mapping)
   - User can recreate meal assignments manually
3. **CKShare caching**: `getShare(for:)` hits CloudKit on every call; could cache per operation

---

## **What's Next**

**M7.3.3: Remove Member & Delete Household**
- Owner can remove a specific member from the household
- Owner can delete the entire household
- Data migration on delete (shared -> personal for owner)
- Confirmation alerts for destructive actions
- Much infrastructure already exists from M7.2.2 work
